## Project Title:
Head Hunters

## Project Description:
CCTV Security Facial Recognition

## Key Objectives:
- Implement Face Detection Model: Use TinyML-compatible lightweight model (e.g., MobileNet) tailored for Arduino to detect and recognize faces within constrained hardware limits.
- Optimize Model for Embedded Constraints: Compress and optimize the model for memory and processing efficiency, ensuring it runs effectively on Arduino hardware.
- Develop Real-time Face Recognition System: Enable real-time face detection and recognition with minimal latency, using camera input and Arduino processing.
- Integrate Feedback Mechanism: Add visual or audio feedback (e.g., LEDs or buzzer) to indicate recognition success or failure, enhancing system interactivity.
- Evaluate Model Accuracy and Performance: Test and refine model accuracy and speed, focusing on high recognition rates and low false positives within the project's hardware constraints.
- Document System Design and Code: Provide clear documentation for the setup, code, and overall system to aid reproducibility and future improvements.

## Technology Stack:
(List the hardware platform, software tools, language(s), etc. you plan to use)

## Expected Outcomes:
(Describe what you expect to deliver at the end of the project)

## Timeline:
- Week 1: Start learning how arduino tinyML kit works. Figure out what it's capable of and the limitiations 
- Week 2: Start developing the algrothim to identify faces, debug any major issues 
- Week 3: Continue working on algrothim potenially add additional functionality
- Week 4: Final software/hardware checks and finish writing up presentation

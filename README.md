## Project Title:
Head Hunters

## Project Description:
This project will create a simple, real-time face detection and recognition system using the Arduino TinyML Kit with a camera. We'll use a lightweight model like MobileNet, tailored to fit Arduino's limited memory and processing power, to detect and recognize faces. Visual or audio feedback (such as LEDs or a buzzer) will indicate if a face is recognized, making the system interactive. We'll test the system to make sure it works accurately and quickly, and provide clear documentation to explain the setup, code, and design for easy understanding and future improvements.

## Key Objectives:
- Implement Face Detection Model: Use TinyML-compatible lightweight model (e.g., MobileNet) tailored for Arduino to detect and recognize faces within constrained hardware limits.
- Optimize Model for Embedded Constraints: Compress and optimize the model for memory and processing efficiency, ensuring it runs effectively on Arduino hardware.
- Develop Real-time Face Recognition System: Enable real-time face detection and recognition with minimal latency, using camera input and Arduino processing.
- Integrate Feedback Mechanism: Add visual or audio feedback (e.g., LEDs or buzzer) to indicate recognition success or failure, enhancing system interactivity.
- Evaluate Model Accuracy and Performance: Test and refine model accuracy and speed, focusing on high recognition rates and low false positives within the project's hardware constraints.
- Document System Design and Code: Provide clear documentation for the setup, code, and overall system to aid reproducibility and future improvements.

## Technology Stack:
The hardware program we plan to use is the Arduino TinyML Kit and Camera.
Software Tools we plan to use are the Aruduino IDE with the Arduino coding language.
We could potentially use Google Colab as well.

## Expected Outcomes:
(Describe what you expect to deliver at the end of the project)

## Timeline:
- Week 1: Start learning how arduino tinyML kit works. Figure out what it's capable of and the limitiations 
- Week 2: Start developing the algrothim to identify faces, debug any major issues 
- Week 3: Continue working on algrothim potenially add additional functionality
- Week 4: Final software/hardware checks and finish writing up presentation

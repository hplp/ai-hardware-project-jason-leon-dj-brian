## Project Title: 
TinyFaces: Real-Time Face Recognition on Arduino

## Milestone 1: 
In this milestone, you will provide the URL of your repo (which reflects the progress) or a PDF document for your progress on November 26th.

If you provide the link to your repo, create an explicit section (or folder) for the milestone. You can provide the link directly to that section.

**Let's provide the link to this specific section when we're done.**

Your progress should reflect the following by providing screenshots, photos, and instructions.


## Set up your hardware (if applicable)

**Provide a picture of the arduino set up on Brian's laptop**

## Identify (or train) your model 

**Explain how we're training our model through feeding many pictures of us, a dataset of random faces found online, and picture of no faces**

## Program your hardware

**Provide an explanation of the repository we found and used to allow us to access the arduino camera**

## Run the first iterations to test the computation module in your system.



## Respond to the feedback in the repo.

**This looks like something we will do after they give us feedback, not sure we need anything on this for now unless it's talking about the proposal feedback?**
